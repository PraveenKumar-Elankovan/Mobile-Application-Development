•	The main activity in the application displays thumbnail pictures of cars from various manufacturers in a grid layout.
•	The thumbnails are separated by thin spaces uniformly on all four sides. 
•	Each thumbnail in the grid view supports two kinds of functionality. 
•	First, a simple click on a thumbnail brings up a new activity that shows the entire picture of the selected car on the entire device display. 
•	The user can return to the grid view by selecting the “back” soft button on the phone. 
•	A long click on any thumbnail will bring up a “context menu” showing the following two options for the car under consideration: 
        1. View the entire picture (similar to a simple click); 
        2. Show the official web page of the make and model for the selected thumbnail in a new activity (e.g., a picture of a Honda Civic would bring up the Civic’s web page in the official Honda web site).
