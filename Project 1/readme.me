• The application contains a text editor window and a button. 
• When the user opens the application, the text editor window is empty. 
• The user then types some text. 
• Embedded in the text could be a phone number in the following format “(xxx) yyy-zzz”. 
• When the text (possibly containing a phone number) is complete, the user will press the button. 
• Now the application will look for a phone number embedded in the text typed by the user. 
• If a phone number conforming to the above format is found, the application will open a dialer window with that phone number showing in the corresponding window. 
• The user may or may not decide to dial the number; however, under no circumstances the application will dial the number automatically.
