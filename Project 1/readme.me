Design and implement the following app: 
** The app contains a text editor window and a button. 
** When the user opens the app, the text editor window is empty. 
** The user then types some text. 
** Embedded in the text could be a phone number in the following format “(xxx) yyy-zzz”. 
** When the text (possibly containing a phone number) is complete, the user will press the button. 
** Now your app will look for a phone number embedded in the text typed by the user. 
** If a phone number conforming to the above format is found, your app will open a dialer window with that phone number showing in the corresponding window. 
** The user may or may not decide to dial the number; however, under no circumstances your app will dial the number automatically.
